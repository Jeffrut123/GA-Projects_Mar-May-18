    "## Bonus Questions:\n",
    "1. Outline your analysis method for predicting your outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the analysis method will be to construct a regression model (least squares fit) based on the historic data (provided in admissions.csv) that relates the independent variables (the student's gre, gpa, prestige) with the likelihood of the student being admitted into graduate school.  The regression model would/should take on the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "admit = a*gre + b*gpa + c*prestige + d\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- admit = probability of the student being admitted (dependent variable)\n",
    "- gre, gpa, prestige are the student applicant's GRE, GPA, and college reputation scores (independent variables), and\n",
    "- a, b, c, and d represent constants (scalers) as determined by developing the regression model   \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regression model itself, various statistical characteristics will be included in the regression model output.  These characteristics describe the accuracy of the model and include standard error (a measure of deviation), R^2 (the percentage of the model's output that is accounted for by the regression equation), and p-values (statistical significance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the regression model is constructed, we can simply load each new applicants' GRE, GPA, and college prestige scores into the model to assess the probability that they are accepted into graduate school.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write an alternative problem statement for your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set, which includes students' GRE, GPA, and college prestige scores do not predict with any accuracy the likelihood that students are accepted into graduate school.  In this case, some other potential predictive factor(s) must be examined. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Articulate the assumptions and risks of the alternative model\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions associated with the alternative model include:\n",
    "- Same assumptions with the primary model (data set is complete, normal distributions, no collinearity/multicollinearity)\n",
    "Risks associated with the alternative model include:\n",
    "- that gre, gpa, and college prestige do, in fact, correlate well with graduate school acceptance\n",
    "- should the hyposthesis of alternative model be valid, the result would be that we're left with no model predicting acceptance"
